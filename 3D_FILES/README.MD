This face sheild was taken from the Prusaprinters.org website :

***Note***
The dimension of the shield may exceed your printers capacity.  The minimun dimensions of the plate are 7" x 7".

The Polycarbonate sheets we used came in 2 Feet x 4 Feet sheets, which we cut into 12"x9" sheets for fitting.  The original plans were for 8.5"x11" (Normal sheet of paper) which also works.  

If you cannot get the sheet of .01 Clear Polycarbonate you can use laminaiton sheets from Office Depot or Staples. 

**We cut the holes for the plastic using a LASER CUTTER, but alternatively you could use a solder gun to pop ahole or a hole punch.  With the accuracy of the laser cutter we were able to avoid using any tape or glue.**
